# coding_quiz
## Description 

As a full-stack web developer, we will have to complete a coding assessmentâ€”perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. The coding quiz game is an application that prepares developers for the interview process. The game consists of HTML, CSS, and Javascript questions.
